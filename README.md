 Here I update my journey towards Robotics and Machine Intelligence.
 Dynamical Systems - Probabilistic Programming - Reinforcement learning
My Work mostly revolves around Motor Cognition. I am actively researching in fields of theoretical neuroscience, Reinforcement learning, Nonlinear dynamics to study motor coordination. To narrow down, I am looking t bimanual coordination in manipulation tasks for example Screw and unscrew the bottle cap with one hand and firmly fixing the bottle with one hand. My work is to derive control laws for robotics to enable bimanual coordination in robotics.
